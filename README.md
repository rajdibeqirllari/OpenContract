OpenContract
============

an Indefinite Delievery Contract Managment System built originally for State Government, 
but good for any organization that needs to manage contracts in this style.

This is an older project that I built under contract.  The code is, frankly, awful in that I had extreme limitations on
the archetecture of this project.  In the next few weeks, I intend to rework this into a MVC application, likely built
under the ZF2.
